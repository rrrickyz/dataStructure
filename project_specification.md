1. what data structures and algorithms will you be using?

primitive data types and array. back tracking might be used to solve this problem.

2. what problem are you solving and why did you chose these specific data structures and
algorithms?

i will be solving the file decryption topic, ideally decrypting a file encrypted with Morse
code. The file should be divided into subfiles recursively for translation, and if the current
translation is wrong, it will go back to the previous one.

3. what is the program input and how will it be used?

The program input should be an encrypted file, and it will be imported into the program.
The output should be that Java write a new, decrypted file.

4. Expected time and space complexities of the program?

the space complexity should be O(n), but the time complexity is undetermined,
presumably O(2^n).

5. Sources?

The encrypted file will be created on my own.

6. Degree programme?

Bachelor's programme in Science.

7. documentation language?

English.
