week 1 report

1. What have you done this week?

Check all the relevant documentations, decide which topic to pick, review the algorithms,
setting up project, and be familiarized with git command.

2. How has the project progressed?

Currently it is only at the setup state, but the topic is decided and I have a rough idea
of how the overall program should be, but it might be incorrect or unpractical. And i will
see if there is any other better alternative.

3. What did you learn this week?

I reviewed some similar codes on the Internet i.e. frequency analysis of Ceaser encryption.

4. What has been unclear or problematic?

so far, so good.

5. What next?

View more codes and see if dynamic programming is more appropriate for this topic. Write
the psudo-code.
